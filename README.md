# Knight Life

## What it is
Knight Life is a mobile application designed to provide direct, useful, and concise information to students looking to get involved. The user will be able to browse through the 650+ clubs available at UCF with the ability to follow or subscribe to the organizations they wish to receive updates from. The app will be organized in a way so that an organization's contact
information, website, and social media accounts are easily accessible. With this straight forward access to information, students will spend less time looking to get involved and more time being involved.

## Goal
Help students get involved with UCF clubs, organizations, and events. The app will improve upon the basis of the current Knight Connect system that is in place.

## User Types
- Guest User: This user will have access to all information regarding organizations and public events. Guests will have full access to settings but will not be able to subscribe to clubs.

- UCF Student Account: This user will have access to all information regarding organizations, public and private events from clubs the student has joined. Students will have full access to settings and can subscribe to clubs that interest them.

- UCF Club Account: This user will have access to all information regarding organizations, public and private events. Club accounts will have the ability to modify clubâ€™s events and information.

- Administrator Account: This user will have access to all information regarding organizations and events. They will be able to manage other user accounts and have access to the database of information from UCF. They will have the ability to hide or modify information pertaining to clubs and events.

## Tabs
- Home: In this view, users will be able to view their customized homepage with the organizations and events they have decided to follow. Every user will have a different home page based on their likes. This will be the default view when the app launches. One problem users might face in this view is the data might get mixed up and not display correctly. This means that the app would misinterpret who the user is, and not display the correct data based on who the user is following.

- Events: This view will take the user into an agenda-like view where they can see all the events going on that day and in the future. Users will be able to choose between two agendas/calendars. One will show all the events going on for all the organizations. The other will only show the events for the organizations the user follows. One problem that users might
face in this view is data overflow. If there are too many events going on at the same time or in the same day, the app might not be able to display them all in a single screen and might cause some events to not be displayed or even make the app freeze.

- Organizations: In this view, users will be able to look through all the organizations currently active at UCF. Once an organization is chosen, relevant data such as the history and contact information of that organization will become available to the user, just to name a couple. Like events, this view will also have two separate modes. A global mode that shows all the
organizations, and a user-customized mode that only shows the organizations the user is following. One problem this view could face would be certain clubs randomly disappearing from the list. Another problem could be the user trying to access a club that no longer exists but is still being displayed.

- Settings: This view will take care of displaying all the application settings. Two things that can be found in this view are the notification preferences and a sign in page so that users can sign in to their personalized accounts. Through the notification settings, users will be able to set up push notifications and set up event reminders for upcoming events. The main problem this view could potentially have is for the settings to stop working. If this view is not implemented correctly, changing settings constantly by a user might cause the app to malfunction.
